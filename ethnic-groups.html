                <h2>Ethnic Groups In The Gambia</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are 8 main ethnic groups in Gambia living side by side with a minimum of inter-tribal friction, 
                    each preserving its own language, music, cultural traditions and even caste systems though there is an increasing 
                    amount of cultural interaction and fusion. Indeed, the average Gambian will tell you he feels he has more in common 
                    with his countrymen than he has with a Senegalese from the same tribe! This by no means suggests that there is a lack 
                    of individual identity. While there is growth in multi-ethnic expressions, the search by groups to reaffirm their identities remains.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Fula:</strong> The second largest ethnic group in The Gambia, However, 
                        it is generally recognized that Fulani descended from nomads from both North Africa and from sub-Sahara Africa.
                         They came from the Middle-East and North Africa and settled into Central and West Africa from the Senegal region.

                    <p><strong>Jola:</strong>
                        Jola people are the fourth largest ethnic group in The Gambia 
                        The Jola are one of the oldest indigenous peoples in the Senegambia region. 
                        Still, little detail is known about their origin and early history. 
                        They likely originated in the Cassamance region of present-day Senegal, 
                        from where they would have migrated north and south.
